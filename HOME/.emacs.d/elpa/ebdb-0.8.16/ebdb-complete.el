;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains the function `ebdb-complete' which pops
;; up a full EBDB window as email-chooser, typically in mail
;; composition buffers.

;; The simplest installation method is to call:

;; (ebdb-complete-enable)

;; This will bind TAB in message-mode and mail-mode to
;; `ebdb-complete', which will pop up a full EBDB buffer as a contact
;; chooser.
;;
;; This can also be done manually, e.g.:
;;
;; (define-key ebdb-mode-map "q" 'ebdb-complete-bury-ebdb-buffer)
;; (define-key ebdb-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 'ebdb-complete-push-mail)
;; (define-key ebdb-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'ebdb-complete-push-mail-and-bury-ebdb-buffer)
;; (define-key message-mode-map "\t" 'ebdb-complete-message-tab)
;; (define-key mail-mode-map "\t" 'ebdb-complete-message-tab)
